Note:
------
If class does not have any constructor compiler will provide default constructor

if class contains default constructor only then compiler will not provide 
any parameterized constructor

if class contains parameterized constructor only then compiler will not provide 
any default constructor.


this keyword:
==============
this is a keyword refers to current class object.

by using this keyword we can call  instance variables and instance methods in another instance method.

by using this()/this(if parameter any )  we can constructor in another constructor

Note
=====
this keyword/ this()  won't be accessed  in static methods.


Assignment:
===========  
Copy Constructor with example.

Call by value and  call by object(passing an object) with example.


Encapsulation:
==============
The process of binding or wrapping  of
data members and member methods as single unit is called Encapsulation.


ex:
---
class


class A{

   //variables  //data members
   // methods  // member methods
 
}

Java bean/ POJO(plain old java object) class is called encapsulated class

what java bean?

A class which contain private access modifier instance variables followed by Getters and Setters.


Inheritance:
============
The process of acquiring the properties and behaviour from  the parent/super class
to child class/sub class.

Inheritance is also called as is-a relation ship.

the main advantage of inheritance is code reusability.

in java every class implicitly extends Object.

Object is the super class for all the classes.

Types:
------
single
multiple
multilevel
hybrid
hierarchal

Assignment:
===========
call by value and call by object(passing an object)
Has-a relation 
Aggregation --- loosely coupled
Composition --- tightly coupled

// var-args(...) -- [] 


public void addition(int x,int y){

}

--> methodSignature

addition(int,int)



public String sayHello(String msg){
  return "";

}

---> sayHello(String);



MethodOverLoading:
==================
In a class having same method name but differs in:

1) No of parameters
2) Differs in data type
3) Order of the type



@Override
default->protected->public
          

Parent:

void show(String msg){


}


Child extends Parent



@Override

protected void show(String msg){


}


// A super class reference variable holding its child class Object
Ex:
-----
Parent referenceVariable = Child();

Execution Flow is :
-------------------
first it will check the method signature in parent class its available then its search the same method
in its holding child class Object, it's available then it will call from child class, if not available
then it will call from the parent.

Super Keyword:
==============
Super keyword refers to Super/Parent class Object.

By using super keyword we can call super/Parent class instance variables and instance methods in Child/Sub class instance method.

Ex:
---
super.VariableName
super.methodName(if any arguments)


By using super Keyword we can call Super/Parent Class Constructors in Child/Sub Class Constructor.

ex:
----
public Child(){
  //super(); //calling super class Constructor
   super(if passing any paramters values) //calling a super class parameter constructor in Child Class Constructor
  
}

Interface:
==========
An interface in the Java programming language is an abstract type that is used to declare a object behavior that classes must implement.

All methods of an Interface do not contain implementation (method bodies).

Interfaces cannot be instantiated, but rather are implemented. 

A class that implements an interface must implement all of the abstracts methods described in the interface.
 
If class partially implemented interface then declare the class as abstract. But for abstract class cannot be instantiated. Then create a new class which extends from abstract class and provide the implementation for 
the unimplemented method which was not implemented in abstract class. Then create the object for newly created
class and access all the implemented methods.

Interfaces can’t have constructors because we can’t instantiate them and interfaces can’t have a method with body.

By default any attribute of interface is public, static and final, so we don’t need to provide access modifiers to the attributes but if we do, compiler doesn’t complain about it either.

By default interface methods are implicitly abstract and public, it makes total sense because the method don’t have body and so that subclasses can provide the method implementation.

An interface can’t extend any class but it can extend another interface.

Note:
-----
A interface can extends another interface

A class can implements more than one interface.

A class can extends another class as well as implement an interface.

10. Recall the topics till what we covered, Monday able to give presentation .


final:
======
We can declare a variable as final, final variable must be initialized it.
once variable declared as final ,if we try to reassignment the final variable ,you will get the error.

we can declare or create a methods as final but final methods cannot be override in the child class/sub class.

we can declare the class as final and we can create the object for the final class. But final classes
cannot be inherited(will not participate in inheritance concept). Ex: String is a final class.



Arrays:
========



what is exception?
what is try-catch-finally?
what is checked exception? list some exception classes?
what is unchecked exception? list some exception classes?
what is the super exception for all the exception?

Difference between throws and throw?
UserDefined Exception?



String:
-------
String is a class available in java.lang package.

String is a final class(we cannot inherited)

Immutable:
----------
In java, string objects are immutable. Immutable simply means unmodifiable or unchangeable. 

Once string object is created its data or state can't be changed but a new string 
object is created. 

In java whenever an immutable string is attempted to be modified then that string will not be 
modified, instead another string is created in non-constant pool(heap segment) with new reference. 

CONSTANT POOL:
============= 
Strings that are created without using new keyword are allocated memory on 
this pool. Duplicates are not allowed. 
 
Non-CONSTANT POOL or Heap Segment:
==================================
Strings that are created using new keyword are allocated memory on this pool. 
Duplicates are allowed. 

Note:
=====
“==” operator to compare two strings. We know “==” operator compares two strings based on the references. 

“equals ()” to compare two strings. We know equals() compares two strings based on the values(content).


Why string objects are immutable in java? 
==========================================
Because java uses the concept of string literal. 

Suppose there are 5 reference variables, all refer to one object "java". 
If one reference variable changes the value of the object, it will 
be affected to all the reference variables. 

That is why string objects are immutable in java.

compareTo():
============
The String compareTo() method compares values lexicographically and 
returns an integer value that describes if first string is less than, equal to or 
greater than second string. 

Suppose s1 and s2 are two string variables. 
If: 
s1 == s2 :0 
s1 > s2   :positive value 
s1 < s2   :negative value 



Case1: 
S1 = "SACHIN"
S2 = "SAURAV"

Comparison happens as shown below 
S A C H I N 
S A U R A V 

Each character is compared in lexical order. In the above example S,A are same 
in both string but when C and U are compared we know that C comes before U 
therefore s1 is considered lesser than s2. Which will give negative number 
when printed on screen. 



Case2: 
S1= "SAURAV" 
S2= "SACHIN" 

Comparison happens as shown below 
S A U R A V 
S A C H I N 

In the above example S,A are same in both string but when U and C are 
compared we know that U comes after C therefore s1 is considered greater 
than s2. Which will give positive number when printed on screen.


Case3: 
S1 = "SACHIN" 
S2 ="SACHIN"
Comparison happens as shown below

S A C H I N 
S A C H I N 
Above we see that all the characters are same in both the strings. Therefore 
when compared character by character there is no character greater or 
smaller than the other which means it will give the result as 0 when printed on 
the screen. 

Case4: 
S1= "JAVA"
S2= "JAVAC"
 
Let’s now see what happens when the size of the string is different. 
J A V A  
J A V A C  

We can see that both the strings contain “JAVA” but the second string has 
extra character C. Therefore second string is considered to be greater than 
the first. And when printed on screen we will get negative number.


s1=Java
s2=JavA





string s1="10";
int = Integer.parseInt(s1);



int b=20;
String a = String.valueOf(b);

Regular Expression:
===================
[abc] - \\w :it represent  either a or b or c
[a-zA-Z] -  :it represent either a to z or A to Z 
[0-9]  -\\d : it represent any number from 0 to 9
^[0-9]- except digits it will represent any lower or uppercase character

Quantifiers:
============
+ -- atleast one time  or any number of times
*  --- zero or any number of times
? -- zero or exactly one time
{n} -- number of occurances
{min,max} -- occurance of pattern min and max no of times.

[.]  -- any time of character
\\s  -- it will present the space

write a regular expression for a mobile number?
sol:

[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]

or
[0-9]{10}

or 

\\d{10}




StringBuffer:
-------------

StringBuffer is final class available in java.lang

StringBuffer is a mutable( changeable or modified the state)

StringBuffer mostly the methods are synchronized(Thread-Safe).


Note:
----
In StringBuffer  "==" operator and equals() method will compare the references.
