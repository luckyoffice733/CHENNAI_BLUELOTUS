Write a Java program to sort an array of positive integers from an array. In the sorted array the value of the first element should be maximum, the second value should be a minimum, third should be the second maximum, the fourth should be the second minimum and so on.  

Sample Input
[10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100]

Sample Output 
[100, 10, 90, 20, 80, 30, 70, 40, 60, 50]


Sol:
=====

public class Solution
{
    // A method to rearrange an array with alternating smaller and larger elements.
    public static int[] rearrange(int[] new_arr, int n)
    {
     //write the code
    }

public static void main(String args[]){



}
